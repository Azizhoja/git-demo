I know that the spades are the swords of a soldier
I know that the clubs are weapons of war
I know that diamonds mean money for this art 
But that's not the shape of my heart

If i told that i loved you
You maybe think there is somthing wrong
I'm not a man of too many faces
The mask i wear is one...
